The THQA database is a quality assessment database designed specifically for the person independent driving methods. It compares 8 popular speech-driven methods and contains a total of 800 talking head videos. If there are any questions or suggestions for improvement against the database, please feel free to contact us by zyj2000@sjtu.edu.cn.
